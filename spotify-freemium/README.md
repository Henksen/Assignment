# Spotify freemium

# TODO:
1. Run Application.java (SpringBoot Application)
2. With Postman, fire a post to http://localhost:8080/api/songs containing the songs.json file in the assignment (added them here for convenience).
3. Also fire a post to http://localhost:8080/api/artists containing the artists.json file
