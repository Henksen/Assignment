7. Add put for artist and song
8. Add delete endpoint by id
9. Add new endpoint for favourite song /songs/favourite

After a nights sleep I decided I want different priorities. 
1. I want unit tests to show I can make unit tests and to make it future proof. 
2. I want the get functionality working so I can test with postman
Also, I decided on no repository IT, but just applicationIT.
